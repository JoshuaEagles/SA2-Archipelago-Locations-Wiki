# City Escape
- The upgrade can be obtained by doing a jump through a part of the wall near the lost chao that has no collision, and then navigating out of bounds to reach the upgrade room. I recommend saving your homing attack until near the end. Note that you cannot escape without the flame ring. [Video](https://youtu.be/eemnrMP9gwE)
