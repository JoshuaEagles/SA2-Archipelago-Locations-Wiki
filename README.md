# SA2 Archipelago Location Wiki

This project aims to include screenshots of every optional in-stage location check for SA2 Archipelago. If you've found this and don't know what Archipelago is, here's a link: https://archipelago.gg/. This could also just be used outside of an Archipelago context, for finding chao-boxes and whistle locations and such. 

This is considered content complete now, with all stages included in the guide. Additional improvements are still planned. 

If you notice any issues or have feedback or suggestions, either create an issue here on github or send me a message on discord Entiss#4057.

Also TODO:
- Re-encode the images to a better format like webp, maybe reduce resolution as well.
- More views for each stage, for example a minimal view that only has 1 screenshot per check or a chronological view.
- Use the SET editor to check for any other locations
- Maybe add logic information beside each image?
- Trim images down, remove unnecessary ones that don't provide value

PRs are welcome to this, but I'll get to everything myself eventually.
