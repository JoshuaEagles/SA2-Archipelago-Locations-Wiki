# SA2 Archipelago Location Wiki

This project aims to include screenshots of every optional in-stage location check for SA2 Archipelago. If you've found this and don't know what Archipelago is, here's a link: https://archipelago.gg/. This could also just be used outside of an Archipelago context, for finding chao-boxes and whistle locations and such. 

Still WIP, adding more stages slowly.

Also TODO:
- Re-encode the images to a better format like webp, maybe reduce resolution as well.
- More views for each stage, for example a minimal view that only has 1 screenshot per check or a chronological view.

PRs are welcome to this, but I'll get to everything myself eventually.
