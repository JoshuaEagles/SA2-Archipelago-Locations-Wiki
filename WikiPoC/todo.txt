DONE - Need to right align the buttons so they look nicer
DONE - Images probably should be bigger

- Change buttons to "Display Item Box Locations" and "Display Life Box Locations", maybe also change the readable location type names to that
- Fix sorting of non-chrono locations after toggling chrono on and off
- Add a "Toggle all filters" button
